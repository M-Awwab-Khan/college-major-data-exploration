# College Majors Salary Data Exploration Project
A Data Exploration Project in Pandas focused on Analysing the Post-University Salaries of Graduates by Major

College degrees are very expensive. But, do they pay you back? Choosing Philosophy or International Relations as a major may have worried your parents, but does the data back up their fears? PayScale Inc. did a year-long survey of 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor's degree. We'll be digging into this data and use Pandas to answer these questions:

- Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 
- Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?
- Which degrees have the highest earning potential?
- What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?
- Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?
